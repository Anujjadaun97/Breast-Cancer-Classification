**Breast Cancer Classification using Machine Learning**

📌 **Project Overview**
This project focuses on predicting whether a breast tumor is malignant or benign using machine learning models.
The dataset used contains various features computed from digitized images of fine needle aspirate (FNA) of breast masses.
The main goal is to build an accurate and interpretable classifier to assist in early diagnosis of breast cancer.
